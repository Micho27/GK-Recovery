			<h1>Description</h1>
			<p>
				Train harder and recover faster with the Recoverite Compression Tights Starter Kit, combining the performance and healing benefits of compression and ice. 
				Compression tights are used by amateurs and professionals alike to help prevent muscle soreness and fatigue, lower risk of injury, lower perceived exertion, 
				promote blood flow and improve oxygenation of muscle tissue while working out. Post workout, compression active-wear also help to speed up recovery times. 
				Featuring expertly designed SuperTube 1.0’ compression technology, 
				these tights combine state of the art compression technology with innovative ‘Ice-otonic Pocket System 1.0’ for optimal ice-compression recovery.
			</p>
			<p>
				Designed by industry experts in endurance sports, these cutting-edge compression tights perform above and beyond standard active-wear thanks to the 8 strategically 
				positioned ice pocket panels that target key muscle groups to soothe discomfort and help speed up recovery caused by strenuous exercise. No more fumbling with bulky 
				ice blocks or frozen bags of peas, these stable, breathable, and durable pockets keep the included slimline ClayFlex™ mouldable gel ice packs securely in place for pain relief even on the move. 
				The ClayFlex™ gel composition is also scientifically designed for dual use heat application, which means the recovery system can be used for hot and cold therapy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recoverite Compression Tights are constructed using state of the art manufacturing technology, the highest quality fabrics, and ultra comfortable flat stitch to ensure high grade, 
				high performance compression. The moisture wicking blend of nylon and lycra provides total UV protection, and is finished with a comfortable non-slip silicone elastic waistband for the perfect fit. 
				Train harder, for longer, with this next level workout gear.
